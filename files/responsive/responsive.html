        <h2 class="titleCard">Jett</h2>
        <p class="pCard">Jett is often regarded as having a 'toxic' attitude towards people.
          she prefers to do things her own way, without relying on a team, and is greatly confident in her own abilities. Jett's immense self-confidence can come across as arrogance, and feel as if she is disregarding her comrade's safety,
          however her voice lines indicate that she is opening up to those around her. </p>

        <p class="pCard">Sage has a kind and compassionate personality,
          being referred to by some as almost 'mother-like'. While still pretty young,
          Sage exudes an inner wisdom of someone much older and more mature. She genuinely cares about the wellbeing of her allies,
          and places great emphasis on collaboration and combined victories </p>

        <p class="pCard">Yoru was the 15th to join the VALORANT Protocol and has Radiant powers.
              Yoru's personality is reminiscent of the "cool" teenagers depicted in Asian entertainment medias. He carries a comb disguised as a butterfly knife,
              further pushing the notion self-image is a high priority for him.. </p>
