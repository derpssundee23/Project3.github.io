    <p><i>The London Eye</i> is also the tallest wheel of its kind in Europe and provides one of the best views of London.
      There is competition from the Shard which holds a higher position than the wheel is
      able to obtain but the fact that the Wheel provides a number of viewpoints ensures it remains a huge attraction</p>
    <br>
    <p><i>Is the london eye worth vising?</i> The simple answer is <i><b>yes</b></i>. This is London’s equivalent to the Eiffel Tower and there’s no denying that London has one of the most impressive skylines in the world.
      On a clear day you can see as far as Windsor Castle, over 20 miles away!
      Landmarks you’ll definitely get to see are Buckingham Palace, St Paul’s Cathedral, the Houses of Parliament, the beautiful London parks, gardens and so much more!</p>

    <p>Since its opening in 1999, the London Eye has stood tall at 135 metres. Supported by an A-frame on only one side, it is the world’s tallest cantilevered observation wheel.
      It is the largest Ferris wheel in Europe, and the most popular paid tourist attraction in Britain, with close to 4 million visitors a year.
      The wheel was constructed in sections that were floated up the River Thames. The wheel was then constructed on the ground before being slowly lifted into place.
      The rim of the Eye looks like a bicycle wheel, and is supported by steel cables and special LED lighting allows the London Eye to light up in various spectacular colors.</p>
