    <p><b><i>London</i></b>, the capital of England and the United Kingdom, is a 21st-century city with history stretching back to Roman times. At its centre stand the imposing Houses of Parliament, the iconic ‘Big Ben’ clock tower and Westminster Abbey, site of British monarch coronations.
      Across the Thames River, the London Eye observation wheel provides panoramic views of the South Bank cultural complex, and the entire city.</p>

      <figcaption><i>The London Eye</i></figcaption>
      <p>The London Eye is the largest observation wheel in the world, built in 1999 on the south bank of the river Thames in London.
        Standing 135 metres high, it gives one a panoramic view of London up to 25 kilometres in all directions. Therefore, it's called The London Eye.
        It is one of London’s most popular tourist attractions for which an admission fee is charged and is sometimes credited with sparking a worldwide revival of Ferris wheel construction.</p>

      <p>The British Museum is unique in bringing together under one roof the cultures of the world, spanning continents and oceans.
        No other museum is responsible for collections of the same depth and breadth, beauty and significance.
        Its eight million objects allow us to explore the extraordinary diversity of human cultures, from small communities to vast empires,
        to discover the many forms and expressions human beings have given to every aspect of life, and to realise how closely they are interconnected.</p>
